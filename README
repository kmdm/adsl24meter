ADSL24 Bandwidth Meter

Copyright (C) 2012 Kenny Millington

Displays your current bandwidth usage vs your scheduled bandwidth usage (determined by average your allowance over the number of weekdays in the current month).

This is not the prettiest code I've written, but it's functional. It was going 
to be kept private but I decided it could be useful for other people who may 
not want to trust my server is not logging their usernames and passwords so
I've released it into the wild!

Please use responsibly in a way that does not impede the normal functionality
of the ADSL24 site.
